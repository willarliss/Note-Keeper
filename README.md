# Note-Keeper
This project offers a SlackBot that a user sends notes to. The notes are saved in the relevant folder on their computer.

To create the SlackBot, one must have a Slack account. With a Slack account, instructions at the following link can be followed to receive a Slack API token and to create a bot: https://slack.com/help/articles/115005265703-Create-a-bot-for-your-workspace. The token should be saved as a string with the variable name TOKEN in a separate file called key.py in the same directory. Notes will also be saved into this directory. The WebSocket library must be installed for this project.
